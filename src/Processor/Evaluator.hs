-- | Core of whole program.
-- | Reduces given Î» term tree to normal-form using simple
-- normal order substitution. If there exists a normal form for a given term,
-- this strategy is guaranteed to produce it.
-- | Detecting terms which don't have normal form is undecidable.
-- | This evaluator will stop once it loops to starting term, but in general
-- IT CAN PERFORM INFINITE CALCULATIONS. 

-- | One beta reduction step.

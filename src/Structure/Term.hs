module SRC.Structure.Term(Term(..)) where

-- | Most important structure in program.
-- | Represents 位 terms after input is processed by PARSER.
-- | Terms are represented internally using De Bruijn indexing (starting from 0).
data Term = 
    Var Int  |      -- Variable
    Abs Term |      -- Abstraction (位. t)
    App Term Term   -- Application (t1 t2)
    deriving Eq

-- | Since we know that all variables will be small letters a-x,
-- we can use a fixed internal mapping for free variables in output:
-- a, b, c, ... = 0, 1, 2, ...
-- | Simply their position in latin alphabet.
-- | Bound variables in output will be outputed as letters prefixed with B.

instance Show Term where
    show = (showTerm 0)

-- | Converts 位 terms to strings.
-- | First argument is depth in term representation tree. - "LAMBDA LEVEL"
-- | It's used to determine which varaiables are bound,
-- which are not and how to convert them.
-- 0 - (...)
-- 1 - 位.(...)
-- etc. ...

-- | Latin alphabet index -> Char
-- | NOTE: While free variables are bounded to a-z nobody says that bounded ones are too,
-- especialy, there is no limit on nesting terms.
-- | Following bounded variable naming scheme works as follows:
-- if x <= 25 -> name(x) in a-z 
-- else z+name(x-25)
